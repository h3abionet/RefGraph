# Primer for assembly graphs from GFA
This is the primer for plotting of assembly graphs from GFA input.

Currently hard-coded to non-GFA test data. Only stacks the fragments without overlap.
Bandage plots the overlap between fragments.

## Checklist
Read GFA.

Incorporate CIGAR tags.

Sliding window viewing.

Improve representation. A lot.

Combine with Variation graph.
